VERSION 1.0 (CHEMBL 35, FOODB 1.0)

The FARFOOD database can be accesed by two different ways:

  (i) You can run farfood.mlapp in MATLAB with data_tesis8.mat within the same folder.
  
  (ii) You can run the standalone application in Linux (farfood_mac) or in Windows (farfood_win)
  
  (iii) If you are interested in the raw data about food/drug similarities, you can download farfood_rawdata folder and execute the Perl script (it will produce a text file with the similarities between all the compounds and all the food molecules)
